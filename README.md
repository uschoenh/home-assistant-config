My home-assistant config currently includes

* Some Ikea Tradfri lightbulbs connected to a Tradfri gateway
* A video camera (Raspberry Pi with motioneye.os)
* Sonoff Basic switches running sonoff-tasmota firmware (MQTT discover)
* A Sonos speaker system
* A MyStrom Switch
* ...and some other sensors

Main focus of the automations is automated switching of lights.
